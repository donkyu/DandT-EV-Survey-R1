Electric vehicles are being rapidly penetrating the automotive market as they are well accordance with semiconductor and computer system evolution as well as environmental friendliness. However, their energy consumption is yet comparable to that of internal combustion engine vehicles while conventional approaches can hardly achieve further significant amount of energy saving. This work is to inspire range of system-level energy saving research providing comprehensive survey on propulsion power, energy-efficient routes, non-propulsion power, vehicle batteries, energy harvesting, power grids for electric vehicles.
